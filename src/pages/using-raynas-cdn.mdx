As of now rayna's cdn doesnt have a definate list of files that you can access and its based on purly if you know the file is on the server and whats it called, although this may change in the future

For example on the cdn ( as of 7/5/23 ) we have a file called `criminal_cat.jpg`. The url and result image can be found below
